        <p> We noticed that western europe dominates the chart. While Asia Pacific falls behind. In Malaysia, we are ranked at 81 while Singapore ranked 32. As a Malaysian, unarguably this is caused by the government losing control of the pandemic. However, this report shows a way for our government to improve citizens’ mental health. Also as a citizen, we do have to adapt to it since changes are not immediate.</p>
